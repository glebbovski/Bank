YOLO Bank was founded as Mondo in 2015 by Tom Blomfield, Jonas Huckestein, Jason Bates, Paul Rippon and Gary Dolman.
The team originally met whilst working at Starling Bank. In February 2016, YOLO set the record for
"quickest crowd-funding campaign in history" when it raised £1m in 96 seconds via the Crowdcube investment platform.

Two weeks prior to the name change, YOLO was granted a restricted banking licence, by the Prudential Regulation
Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority and in April 2017 these restrictions were lifted. YOLO had a number of
prepaid debit cards in operation which it issued to users for testing purposes. These cards were in use until current
accounts were made available to all and the prepaid programme was closed on 4 April 2018.

On 16 May 2017, YOLO announced that over £250 million had been spent through its prepaid card, between
200,000 customers.

YOLO initially traded as Mondo. On 13 June 2016, a company blog post announced that the "Mondo" trademark had been
legally challenged by an undisclosed company with a similar name. As a result, a naming suggestion contest was
organised and the new name, "YOLO", was registered at Companies House under the legal name "YOLO Bank Ltd"
in August 2016.

On 17 July 2017, YOLO announced the current account preview and began inviting eligible customers to sign-up for
a preview of the full current account. Initially, customers attended events at the company's offices in London but
cards were also sent out via post. In line with the company's general stance on transparency, the YOLO website includes
a live counter showing progress on the rollout.

In October 2017, YOLO announced that it would be discontinuing free ATM withdrawals abroad, replacing them with a free
monthly withdrawal of up to £200 and a charge of 3% on subsequent withdrawals. This change came into effect
on 18 December 2017.

On 7 June 2018 YOLO announced an integration with IFTTT which allowed users to connect their account to smart devices
and services. For example, connecting YOLO to Amazon Alexa.

On 25 June 2018, YOLO announced their team up with TransferWise to provide international money transfers from within
their YOLO app. Existing TransferWise customer can connect their account to use along YOLO app. It was later announced
in November 2018 that interest would be paid on savings (in 'Savings Pots' above £1,000) in collaboration with Investec.

In October 2018, YOLO reached one million customers, and was also named the best tech startup to work for by
LinkedIn UK.

On 21 November 2018, YOLO added the functionality for users to pay cash into their YOLO accounts using PayPoint,
charging users £1 for each deposit.

On 28 January 2019, YOLO announced a partnership with Flux to add itemised receipts and loyalty points.
In addition to this, the API to create receipts was published by YOLO.

In August 2019, the company announced that it had inadvertently logged 480,000 customer personal
identification numbers, making them accessible to YOLO's internal team of engineers. The issue arose because PINs were
transmitted in the query string of a HTTPS request. That month the company also launched its loan products
for customers.

In March 2020, YOLO announced the creation of two business bank accounts for sole traders and small to medium sized
businesses. In May, Blomfield announced that he was moving from CEO to president of the company and TS Anil would
become the company's CEO.

In July 2020, YOLO launched its new premium subscription service, YOLO Plus. Within the first month,
the premium account had gained over 50,000 active users.

In October 2020, YOLO launched its new top tier subscription service, YOLO Premium.

In February 2021, YOLO announced Carol Nelson as the new US CEO, taking over from TS Anil who is now YOLO's UK CEO
after temporarily holding both CEO titles.
